# Shopify Product Counter
I think Shopify product counters are pretty cool but couldn't find any on Github.
So I made this really basic one. If you want to use proxies or want to change anything else you have to do it yourself.

Currently it works for sites that use the collections new and all.
If your site works with any other collections you have to change that.
